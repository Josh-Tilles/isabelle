                       The Isabelle System Distribution

Version information

   This is the internal repository version of Isabelle.

   See the NEWS file in the distribution for details on user-relevant
   changes.

System requirements

   Isabelle requires a regular Unix platform (e.g. GNU Linux) with the
   following additional software:
     * A full Standard ML Compiler (works best with Poly/ML 5.2.1).
     * The GNU bash shell (version 3.x or 2.x).
     * Perl (version 5.x).
     * GNU Emacs (version 21, 22, 23) or XEmacs (version 21.4.x)
       -- for the Proof General interface.
     * A complete LaTeX installation -- for document preparation.

Installation

   Binary packages are available for Isabelle/HOL and ZF for several
   platforms from the Isabelle web page. The system may be easily
   built from scratch, using the tar.gz source distribution. See file
   INSTALL as distributed with Isabelle for more information.

   Further background information may be found in the Isabelle System
   Manual, distributed with the sources (directory doc).

User interface

   The main Isabelle user interface is Proof General by David Aspinall
   and others. It is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants,
   including Isabelle. Proof General is suitable for use by pacifists
   and Emacs militants alike. Its most prominent feature is script
   management, providing a metaphor of live proof script editing.
   Proof General also provides some support for mathematical symbols
   displayed on screen.
