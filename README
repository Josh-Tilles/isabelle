                       The Isabelle System Distribution

Version information

   This is some unidentified repository version of Isabelle.

   See the NEWS file in the distribution for details on user-relevant
   changes.

System requirements

   Isabelle requires a regular Unix-style platform (e.g. Linux,
   Windows with Cygwin, Mac OS) and depends on the following main
   add-on tools:

     * The Poly/ML compiler and runtime system (version 5.2.1 or later).
     * The GNU bash shell (version 3.x or 2.x).
     * Perl (version 5.x).
     * GNU Emacs (version 22) -- for the Proof General interface.
     * A complete LaTeX installation -- for document preparation.

Installation

   Completely integrated bundles including the full Isabelle sources,
   documentation, add-on tools and precompiled logic images for
   several platforms are available from the Isabelle web page.

   Further background information may be found in the Isabelle System
   Manual, distributed with the sources (directory doc).

User interface

   The classic Isabelle user interface is Proof General by David
   Aspinall and others. It is a generic Emacs interface for proof
   assistants, including Isabelle.  Its most prominent feature is
   script management, providing a metaphor of stepwise proof script
   editing.  Proof General also provides some support for mathematical
   symbols displayed on screen.
