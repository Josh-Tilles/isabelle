		     ISABELLE-92 DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISABELLE-92 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER VERSIONS.  PLEASE CONSULT THE
DOCUMENTATION.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the complete Isabelle system.  To build and test the
entire system, including all object-logics, use the shell script make-all.
Pure Isabelle and each of the object-logics can be built separately using the
Makefiles in the respective directories; read them for more information.

				THE MAKEFILES

The Makefiles can use two different Standard ML compilers: Poly/ML version
1.88MSX or later (from Abstract Hardware Ltd) and Standard ML of New Jersey
(Version 75 or later).  Poly/ML is a commercial product and costs money,
but it is reliable and its database system is convenient for interactive
work.  SML of New Jersey requires lots of memory and disc space, but it is
free and its code sometimes runs faster.  Both compilers are perfectly
satisfactory for running Isabelle.

The Makefiles and make-all use enviroment variables that you should set
according to your site configuration.

ISABELLEBIN is the directory to hold Poly/ML databases or New Jersey ML
images.  When using Poly/ML, ISABELLEBIN must be an absolute pathname (one
starting with "/").

ML_DBASE is an absolute pathname to the initial Poly/ML database (not
required for New Jersey ML).

ISABELLECOMP is the ML compiler, typically "poly -noDisplay" or "sml".  If
ISABELLECOMP begins with the letters "poly" then the Makefiles assume that
it is Poly/ML; if it begins with the letters "sml" then they assume
Standard ML of New Jersey.


			 STRUCTURE OF THIS DIRECTORY

The directory Pure containes pure Isabelle, which has no object-logic.

Other important files include...
    COPYRIGHT   	Copyright notice and Disclaimer of Warranty
    make-rulenames	shell script used during Make
    make-all		shell script for building entire system
    expandshort		shell script to expand "shortcuts" in files
    prove_goal.el       Emacs command to change proof format
    xlisten		shell script for running Isabelle under X
    teeinput		shell script to run Isabelle, logging inputs to a file
    theory-template.ML	template file for defining new theories
    Pure		directory of source files for Pure Isabelle
    Provers		directory of generic theorem provers

xlisten sets up a window running Isabelle, with a separate small "listener"
window, which keeps a log of all input lines.  This log is a useful record
of a session.  If you are not running X windows, teeinput can still be used at
least to record (if not to display) the log.

The following subdirectories contain object-logics:
    FOL 	Natural deduction logic (intuitionistic and classical)
    ZF		Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory
    CTT		Constructive Type Theory
    HOL		Classical Higher-Order Logic
    LK		Classical sequent calculus
    Modal	The modal logics T, S4, S43
    LCF         Logic for Computable Functions (domain theory)
    Cube	Barendregt's Lambda Cube

Object-logics include examples files in subdirectory ex or file ex.ML.
These files can be loaded in batch mode.  The commands can also be
executed interactively, using the windows on your workstation.  This is a
good way to get started.

Each object-logic is built on top of Pure Isabelle, and possibly on top of
another object logic (like FOL or LK).  A database or binary called Pure is
first created, then the object-logic is loaded on top.  Poly/ML extends
Pure using its "make_database" operation.  Standard ML of New Jersey starts
with the Pure core image and loads the object-logic's ROOT.ML.

		HOW TO GET A STANDARD ML COMPILER

To obtain Poly/ML, contact Mike Crawley <mjc@ahl.co.uk> at Abstract
Hardware Ltd, The Howell Building, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH,
England.

To obtain Standard ML of New Jersey, contact David MacQueen
<dbm@com.att.research> at AT&T Bell Laboratories, 600 Mountain Avenue,
Murray Hill, NJ 07974, USA.  This compiler is available by FTP.  Connect to
research.att.com; login as anonymous with your userid as password; set
binary mode; transfer files from the directory dist/ml.
