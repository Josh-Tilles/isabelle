                       The Isabelle System Distribution

Version information

   This is some unidentified repository version of Isabelle.

   See the NEWS file in the distribution for details on user-relevant
   changes.

Installation

   Isabelle work on the three main platform families: Linux, Mac OS X,
   and Windows (via Cygwin).

   Completely integrated bundles including the full Isabelle sources,
   documentation, add-on tools and precompiled logic images for
   several platforms are available from the Isabelle web page.

   Some background information may be found in the Isabelle System
   Manual, distributed with the sources (directory doc).

User interfaces

   Isabelle/jEdit is an emerging Prover IDE based on advanced
   technology of Isabelle/Scala.  It provides a metaphor of continuous
   proof checking of a versioned collection of theory sources, with
   instantaneous feedback in real-time and rich semantic markup
   associated with the formal text.

   The classic Isabelle user interface is Proof General by David
   Aspinall and others.  It is a generic Emacs interface for proof
   assistants, including Isabelle.  Its most prominent feature is
   script management, providing a metaphor of stepwise proof script
   editing.
