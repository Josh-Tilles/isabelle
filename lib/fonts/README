Note on fonts and remote X11
============================

You may want to install this directory on any machine that is used as
X11 terminal for Isabelle sessions, but does not mount the full
distribution.

In case the fonts directory does not appear on both the client and
server side at the same location, the ISABELLE_INSTALLFONTS setting
has to be adapted, though.
