      <h2>Installing on Mac OS X</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> is the current version
      of the Macintosh operating system, installed on all new <a href=
      "http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> computers. Because it is based on Unix, it
      can run <a href=
      "http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a>. The new
      <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Power Mac G5</a> is an excellent
      Isabelle machine. Here is a <a href=
      "//dist/img/screenshot_isabelle_macos.jpg">screenshot</a> showing Proof General running
      in GNU Emacs.</p>
    
      <p>This page gives advice on building Isabelle for Mac OS X. It assumes that
      you are familiar with both Mac OS X and Unix. You must have installed the Mac
      OS X developer tools.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Download Isabelle to a suitable directory, as described on the
          <a href="download.html">download page</a>. Be sure to get the following
          files
    
          <ul>
                <li><?value key="distname"?>.tar.gz</li>
                <li>ProofGeneral.tar.gz</li>
                <li>polyml_base.tar.gz</li>
                <li>polyml_ppc-darwin.tar.gz</li>
                <li>HOL_ppc-darwin.tar.gz</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>You may have to install the bash shell. Versions of Mac OS X prior to
        10.2.2 did not provide it. If /bin/bash does not exist, you can install it
        using the package manager <a href=
        "http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>.</li>
    
        <li>At this point, you should be able to run Isabelle with the command line
        interface. You can also build Isabelle from the Unix command line,
        following the instructions for "Compiling Logics" in file
        <tt class="shellcmd">Isabelle/INSTALL.</tt></li>
    
        <li>You should also be able to launch <a href=
        "http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Proof General</a> by typing
        <tt class="shellcmd">Isabelle</tt> at the Unix command line. This will invoke the
        Apple-supplied version of Emacs in a terminal window, providing a primitive
        environment. Somewhat better is to run Proof General from within a version
        of Emacs ported as a native Mac OS X application, such as <a href=
        "http://home.att.ne.jp/alpha/z123/emacs-mac-e.html">MacEmacs JP</a> or
        <a href="http://mindlube.com/products/emacs/">mindlube's</a> or <a href=
        "http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/%7efranconi/mac-emacs/">Enhanced Carbon Emacs</a>.
        Visiting a theory file from Emacs will automatically launch Proof General
        provided <tt class="shellcmd">isabelle</tt> is on the search path. None of these options
        support the X-Symbol package, unfortunately.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>In order to get the full benefit of Proof General, you must install the X
      Window System (X11) and <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a> or
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">GNU Emacs</a>.</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">Apple's version</a> of X11
        is included with the Panther (MacOS 10.3) installation discs, though it is
        not installed by default. The Command key serves as Meta, but it is
        reserved for standard Apple shortcuts such as C, V and X, so you must use
        Esc-C, Esc-V and Esc-X in Emacs or else deselect "Enable key equivalents"
        in the X11 preferences.</li>
    
        <li>Some people prefer the <a href=
        "http://www.osxgnu.org/software/Xwin/WindowManagers/OroborOSX/">OroborOSX</a>
        window manager. It must be used in conjunction with <a href=
        "http://xfree86.org/">XFree86</a>, which is easy to install if you use the
        installer provided by the <a href=
        "http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX</a> project.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>The easiest way to install XEmacs or GNU Emacs is via the package manager
      <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>. Install the Fink package
      <tt>xemacs-sumo-pkg</tt> to get the XEmacs libraries that Proof General needs
      to run. To install GNU Emacs, install the package <tt>emacs21</tt>. Fink can
      compile from sources, but this takes hours, so it is better to request binary
      installations.</p>
    
      <p>To use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">GNU
      Emacs</a> instead of <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, you must
      recompile Proof General and X-Symbol following the instructions <a href=
      "http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/FAQ">here</a>. Note that Proof General
      incorporates its own copy of X-Symbol.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Install X11 or OroborOSX.</li>
    
        <li>Install XEmacs (and its libraries), or install GNU Emacs and recompile
        Proof General.</li>
    
        <li>You may want to install this drag-and-drop <a href=
        "IsabelleDroplet.dmg">Isabelle launcher</a>. It is a simple hack that
        invokes xemacs on any files dropped on it.</li>
      </ol>
