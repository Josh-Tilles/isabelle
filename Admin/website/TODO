For the next release:

- add CONTRIBUTORS and COPYRIGHT to Packages

- clarify purpose of the rsync daemon, consider
  a rsyncd module for *both* main and dist;
  upgrade rsync on atbroy1 to protocol 28,
  to handle symlinks appropriately (?)

In the mid-time:

- a gentle intro enumeration on Home - "Why Isabelle?"
    * stably running, mature system
    * (something to say about Isar?)
    * big library
    * big community
    * it's free
    * ...
  (to discuss)

- clarify relationship of "overview" and "logics":
    * overview: Isabelle/HOL   
    * logics:   Isabelle system
  (to discuss)

- introduce "mirror switch boxes"
  (to discuss)

Visionary:

- unify dist and main
