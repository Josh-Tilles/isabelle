This distribution of Poly/ML 5.1 has been compiled from the original
sources (available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/) as
follows:

  tar xvzf polyml.5.1.tar.gz
  cd polyml.5.1
  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/polyml --without-x
  make
  make install

Now /tmp/polyml/bin/* and /tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.1/x86-linux).  Note
that the script Isabelle/lib/scripts/polyml-platform identifies your
platform.
