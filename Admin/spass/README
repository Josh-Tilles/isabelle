This distribution of SPASS 3.0 has been compiled according to the
INSTALL instructions of the official source download from
http://www.spass-prover.org

The following example is for x86-linux:

  $ tar xvzf spass30.tgz
  $ cd SPASS-3.0
  $ ./configure --prefix="$HOME/tmp/spass" --exec-prefix="$HOME/tmp/spass/x86-linux"
  $ make
  $ make install


The x86-darwin platform works the same; use "make distclean" before
reconfiguration.

Native x86_64 is avoided here, due to numerous compiler warnings about
int/pointer casts of different size.  The x86 binaries are used
instead.

For x86-cygwin we have removed the "__inline__" configuration to
workaround a problem with "___sgetc_r":

diff configure-orig configure
3522c3522
<   CFLAGS="-O3 -D__inline__="
---
>   CFLAGS="-O3"
