This distribution of Poly/ML 5.3 is based on the original
polyml.5.3.tar.gz from http://www.polyml.org with some minimal changes:

diff polyml.5.3/libpolyml/processes.cpp-orig polyml.5.3/libpolyml/processes.cpp
995,996c995,996
<     // we set this to 100ms so that we're not waiting too long.
<     if (maxMillisecs > 100) maxMillisecs = 100;
---
>     // we set this to 10ms so that we're not waiting too long.
>     if (maxMillisecs > 10) maxMillisecs = 10;


Then it is compiled as follows:

  cd polyml.5.3
  ./configure --prefix="$HOME/tmp/polyml"
  make
  make install


Now $HOME/tmp/polyml/bin/* and $HOME/tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.3.0/x86-linux).
