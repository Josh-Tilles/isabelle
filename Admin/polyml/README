Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This distribution of Poly/ML 5.4 has been compiled from the original
sources using the included build script.  For example:

  ./build polyml.5.4 x86-linux --with-gmp

The resulting executables and shared libraries are moved to
x86-linux/.  This directory layout accomodates the standard ML_HOME
settings for Isabelle.
