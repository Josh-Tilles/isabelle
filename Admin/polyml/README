This distribution of Poly/ML 5.2.1 has been compiled from the original
sources as follows:

  tar xvzf polyml.5.2.1.tar.gz
  cd polyml.5.2.1
  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/polyml
  make
  make install

Now /tmp/polyml/bin/* and /tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.2.1/x86-linux).  Note
that Isabelle/lib/scripts/polyml-platform identifies your platform.
