This distribution of Poly/ML 5.3 has been compiled from the original
sources as follows:

  tar xvzf polyml.5.3.tar.gz
  cd polyml.5.3
  ./configure --prefix="$HOME/tmp/polyml"
  make
  make install

Now $HOME/tmp/polyml/bin/* and $HOME/tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.3.0/x86-linux).
Note that Isabelle/lib/scripts/polyml-platform identifies your
platform.
