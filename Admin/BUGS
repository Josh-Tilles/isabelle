Isabelle BUGS -- history of reported faults
===========================================

1.  Symptom: hyp_subst_tac does nothing if the selected equality involves type
    unknowns.  Cause: it uses the simplifier, which ignores such equalities.
    Fix: check for type unknowns in hypsubst/inspect_pair;  change interface
    function dest_eq to return the type of the equality. (lcp, 5/11/97)

2.  Symptom: read_instantiate_sg has problems instantiating types in some
    simultaneous instantiations (Message-id: <199710301432.PAA20594@sirius.Informatik.Uni-Bremen.DE> on isabelle-users)
