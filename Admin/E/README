This distribution of E 0.999-006 has been compiled according to the
README included in the official version from
http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html

  $ tar xvzf E.tgz
  $ cd E
  $ make install
  $ make install-exec

The resulting eproof executable has been changed to be relocatable:

  $ diff eproof-orig eproof
  1c1
  < #!/bin/bash -f
  ---
  > #!/usr/bin/env bash
  3c3,4
  < EXECPATH=~/bin
  ---
  > set -o noglob
  > EXECPATH="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd)"

Now all executables are moved to the platform-specific target
directory (e.g. E/x86-linux).
