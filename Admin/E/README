This distribution of E 1.0-004 has been compiled according to the
README included in the official version from
http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html

  $ tar xvzf E.tgz
  $ cd E
  $ ./configure
  $ make

The PROVER/eproof executable has been replaced by a version written in
perl (by Sascha Boehme).

Now the main executables in PROVER/ are moved to the platform-specific
target directory (E/x86-linux etc.).
