This distribution of E 1.0-004 has been compiled according to the
README included in the official version from
http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html

  $ tar xvzf E.tgz
  $ cd E
  $ ./configure
  $ make

The resulting PROVER/eproof executable has been changed to be
relocatable:

  $ diff eproof-orig eproof
  1c1
  < #!/bin/bash -f
  ---
  > #!/usr/bin/env bash
  3c3,4
  < EXECPATH=/Users/schulz/SOURCES/Projects/E/PROVER
  ---
  > set -o noglob
  > EXECPATH="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd)"

Now the main executables in PROVER/ are moved to the platform-specific
target directory (E/x86-linux etc.).
