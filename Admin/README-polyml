This distribution of Poly/ML 5.2 has been compiled from the original
sources as follows:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@polyml.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/polyml co polyml
  cd polyml
  cvs up -dAP
  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/polyml --without-x
  make
  make install

Now /tmp/polyml/bin/* and /tmp/polyml/lib/* are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g. polyml-5.2/x86-linux).  Run
Isabelle/lib/scripts/polyml-platform to identify your platform.
