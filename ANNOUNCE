Subject: Announcing Isabelle2002
To: isabelle-users@cl.cam.ac.uk

Isabelle2002 is now available.

In this release many important aspects of Isabelle have been reworked
to improve robustness and usability (this occasionally causes
incompatibility with earlier versions).

The most prominent highlights of Isabelle2002 are as follows; see the
NEWS of the distribution for more details.

  * The Isabelle/HOL tutorial has been published as LNCS 2283;
    Isabelle2002 is the official version to go along with that book.

  * Explicit proof terms for Isabelle/Pure (Stefan Berghofer);
    all object-logics, proof tools etc. will automatically benefit.

  * Interation of locales

  * Specific support for Poly/ML 4.1.1 and PolyML/4.1.2
    (manage larger heaps, slightly faster).
