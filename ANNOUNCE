To: isabelle-users@cl.cam.ac.uk

Isabelle2009-1 is now available.

This release improves upon Isabelle2009 in many ways, see the NEWS
file in the distribution for more details.  Some important changes
are:

* Isabelle tool "wwwfind" provides web interface for 'find_theorems'
on a given logic image.

* HOL-SMT: proof method "smt" for a combination of first-order logic
with equality, linear and nonlinear (natural/integer/real) arithmetic,
and fixed-size bitvectors.

* HOL-Boogie: an interactive prover back-end for Boogie and VCC.

* HOL: Counterexample generator tool Nitpick based on the Kodkod
relational model finder.

* HOL: predicate compiler turning inductive into (executable)
equational specifications.

* HOL: refined number theory.

* HOL: various parts of multivariate analysis.

* HOLCF: new definitional domain package.

* Revised tutorial on locales.

* Support for Poly/ML 5.3.0, with improved reporting of compiler
errors and run-time exceptions, including detailed source positions.

* Parallel checking of nested Isar proofs, with improved scalability
up to 8 cores.
