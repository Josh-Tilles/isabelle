Subject: Announcing Isabelle2007
To: isabelle-users@cl.cam.ac.uk

Isabelle2007 is finally available.

This release introduces fundamental changes over Isabelle2005, see the
NEWS file in the distribution for more details.  Numerous existing
concepts have been generalized and re-implemented based on novel
system architecture.  New theories and proof tools have been added
(mostly for HOL).

The main highlights are:

* Support for nominal datatypes (binding structures) due to the
HOL-Nominal logic.

* General local theory infrastructure for specifications depending on
parameters and assumptions (e.g. from locales, classes).

* New basic specification elements 'definition', 'axiomatization',
'abbreviation', 'notation'.

* New version of 'inductive' package for inductive predicates;
separate variant 'inductive_set'.

* New 'function' package for general recursive function definitions.

* New 'class' package combination of axclass + locale interpretation.

* Various improvements in locale infrastructure (interpretation etc.)

* Various improvements of Isar language elements and related proof
tools.

* Built-in Metis prover, external linkup for automated provers, and
'sledghammer' command for automated proof synthesis.

* Second generation code-generator for a subset of HOL, targeting SML,
Haskell, and OCaml.

* Improved support for arbitrary ML operations depending on the
logical context.

* Parallel loading of theories based on native multicore support in
Poly/ML 5.1.
