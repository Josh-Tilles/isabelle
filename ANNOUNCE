    More robust, less disk space required.

  * Simplifier (Stefan Berghofer)
    Proper implementation as a derived rule, outside the kernel!

  * Improved document preparation (Markus Wenzel)
    Near math-mode, sub/super scripts, more symbols etc.

  * Isabelle/Isar (Markus Wenzel)
    Numerous usability improvements, e.g. support for initial
    schematic goals, failure prediction of subgoal statements,
    handling of non-atomic statements in induction.

  * HOL/Library (Gertrud Bauer, Tobias Nipkow, Lawrence C Paulson,
      Thomas M Rasmussen, Markus Wenzel)
    A collection of generic theories to be used together with main HOL.

  * HOL/Real and HOL/Hyperreal (Jacques Fleuriot, Lawrence C Paulson)
    General cleanup, more on nonstandard real analysis.

  * HOL/Unix (Markus Wenzel)
    Some Aspects of Unix file-system security; demonstrates
    Isabelle/Isar in typical system modelling and verification tasks.
