Isabelle2009-2 is now available.

This release improves upon Isabelle2009-1 in many respects, see the
NEWS file in the distribution for more details.  Some notable changes
are:

* Explicit proof terms for type class reasoning.

* Robust treatment of concrete syntax for different logical entities;
mixfix syntax in local proof context.

* Type declarations and notation within local theory context.

* HOL: package for quotient types.

* HOL code generation: simple concept for abstract datatypes obeying
invariants (e.g. red-black trees).

* HOL: new development of the Reals using Cauchy Sequences.

* HOL: reorganization of abstract algebra type class hierarchy.

* HOL: substantial reorganization of main library and related tools.

* HOLCF: reorganization of 'domain' package.
