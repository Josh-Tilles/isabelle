\glossary{Proof state}{The whole configuration of a structured proof,
consisting of a \seeglossary{proof context} and an optional
\seeglossary{structured goal}.  Internally, an Isar proof state is
organized as a stack to accomodate block structure of proof texts.
For historical reasons, a low-level \seeglossary{tactical goal} is
occasionally called ``proof state'' as well.}
