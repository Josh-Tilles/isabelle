ERRATA FOR ISABELLE MANUAL

** THM : BASIC INFERENCE **

Pure/tactic/lift_inst_rule: now checks for distinct parameters (could also
compare with free variable names, though).  Variables in the insts are now
lifted over all parameters; their index is also increased.  Type vars in
the lhs variables are also increased by maxidx+1; this is essential for HOL
examples to work.


** THEORY MATTERS (GENERAL) **

Definitions: users must ensure that the left-hand side is nothing
more complex than a function application -- never using fancy syntax.  E.g.
never
>     ("the_def",      "THE y. P(y) == Union({y . x:{0}, P(y)})" ),
but
<     ("the_def",      "The(P) == Union({y . x:{0}, P(y)})" ),

Provers/classical, simp (new simplifier), tsimp (old simplifier), ind
