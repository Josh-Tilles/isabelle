\chapter{Presenting theories}
\label{ch:thy-present}

By virtue of the previous chapters the reader has become sufficiently
acquainted with basic formal theory development in Isabelle/HOL.  The
subsequent interlude covers the ``marginal'' issue of presenting theories in a
typographically pleasing manner.  Isabelle provides a rich infrastructure for
concrete syntax (input and output of the $\lambda$-calculus language), as well
as document preparation of theory texts based on existing PDF-{\LaTeX}
technology.

As has been pointed out by Leibniz\index{Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm} more than
300 years ago, \emph{notions} are in principle more important than
\emph{notations}, but fair textual representation of ideas is very important
to reduce the mental effort in actual applications.
