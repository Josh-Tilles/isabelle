\chapter{Advanced Simplification, Recursion and Induction}
\markboth{}{CHAPTER 4: ADVANCED SIMPLIFICATION, RECURSION ...}

Although we have already learned a lot about simplification, recursion and
induction, there are some advanced proof techniques that we have not covered
yet and which are worth knowing about if you intend to beome a serious
(human) theorem prover. The three sections of this chapter are almost
independent of each other and can be read in any order. Only the notion of
\emph{congruence rules}, introduced in the section on simplification, is
required for parts of the section on recursion.
