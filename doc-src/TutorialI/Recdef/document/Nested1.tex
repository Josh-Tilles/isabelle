Although the definition of \isa{trev} below is quite natural, we will have
to overcome a minor difficulty in convincing Isabelle of its termination.
It is precisely this difficulty that is the \textit{raison d'\^etre} of
this subsection.

Defining \isa{trev} by \isacommand{recdef} rather than \isacommand{primrec}
simplifies matters because we are now free to use the recursion equation
suggested at the end of \S\ref{sec:nested-datatype}:%
