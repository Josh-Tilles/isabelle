For Isabelle2005:

- update course material slides to new theory format (Tobias)

- modular generation of ML code with structures (Stefan)

- finding rewrite rules based on PG subterm selection (Tobias)

- a global "disprove" menu item both as an action and (if it can be done)
  as a setting (Stefan & Tjark)

- check/establish conformity of HTML files to (some version of) the HTML
  language specification (cf. http://validator.w3.org/) (Tjark, or anyone
  who is interested)
  
- fix the inductive definition bug (Larry): Equations in the intro rules can make proofs fail. Perhaps the critical proof could "protect" the initial equations e.g. by disjoining False, and removing this later.
  
- update or remove ex/MT (Larry? Tobias?)  

- Include IsaPlanner? (Larry to co-ordinate)

- remove this file (Tobias)
