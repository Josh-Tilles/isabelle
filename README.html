<h1>The Isabelle System Distribution</h1>

<h2>Version information</h2>

This is an internal working version of Isabelle.  Compared to the
Isabelle94 line it introduces many new features, but also some
imcompatibilities.  See the <tt>NEWS</tt> file in the distribution for
more details.


<h2>System requirements</h2>

Isabelle requires a real Unix box with sufficient resources. Fun
starts at about 32MB of memory (somewhat depending on your ML system),
with several tens of MB disk space and a relatively fast CPU.

<p>

Furthermore, it needs the following software, which is not part of the
distribution:
<ul>
<li> A full Standard ML Compiler (e.g. Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey).
<li> The GNU bash shell (version 1.x or 2.x).
<li> Perl 5.x - the Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.
</ul>

<p>

The following ML system and platform combinations are known to work
quite well:
<ul>
<li> Poly/ML versions 2.x and 3.1 on Suns.
<li> SML/NJ 0.93 on Suns and SGIs. There seem to be several
problems with Linux and HP-UX.
<li> SML/NJ versions 109.27 to 109.33 on Suns, Linux, etc.
<li> SML/NJ 110 on Suns, Linux, etc.
</ul>

<p>

<a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/software.html">SML/NJ</a>
needs lots of store and disk space, but it is free.  The current
official release is 110.  We also still support the old 0.93 release
and working versions 109.27 to 109.33.

<p>

<a href="http://www.ahl.co.uk/poly-ml.html">Poly/ML</a> is a
commercial product and costs money, but it is stable and efficient. It
requires relatively little memory (starting at about 16MB) and disk
space (about 60MB for all distributed object logics).

<p>

<a href="http://www.harlequin.com/products/ads/ml/">MLWorks</a> is a
commercial ML programming environment.  Isabelle on MLWorks should be
still considered experimental!

<p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

See file <tt>INSTALL</tt> in the Isabelle sources on how to build the
system. Further background information may be found in the
<em>Isabelle System Manual</em>, distributed as <tt>dvi</tt> with the
sources.


<h2>Interfaces</h2>

The distribution includes only a very primitive interface based on
ordinary terminal sessions.<p>

<a href="ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/da/Isamode.tar.gz">Isamode</a> by
David Aspinall is a more elaborate interface for Isabelle.  It runs
under recent versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs, the latter being
recommended.  It's useful to both novices and experts.
