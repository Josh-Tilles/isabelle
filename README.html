<h1>The Isabelle System Distribution</h1>

<h2>Version information</h2>

This is the internal repository version of Isabelle.  The current line
of Isabelle99 development introduces many new features, with only a
few incompatibilities over Isabelle98-X.  See the <tt>NEWS</tt> file
in the distribution for more details.


<h2>System requirements</h2>

Isabelle requires a real Unix box with sufficient resources. Fun
starts at about 32-64 MB of main memory (somewhat depending on your ML
system), with several tens of MB disk space and a decent CPU.
Speaking by today's hardware standards, any moderate Linux box should
make a nice platform for Isabelle.

<p>

Furthermore, Isabelle needs the following software, which is not part
of the distribution:
<ul>
<li> A full Standard ML Compiler (e.g. SML of New Jersey).
<li> The GNU bash shell (version 1.x or 2.x).
<li> Perl 5.x - the Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister (Perl 4.x
is <em>not</em> sufficient).
</ul>

<p>

The following ML system and platform combinations are known to work
very well:
<ul>
<li> SML/NJ 110.x on any Unix platform (e.g. Linux, Suns).
<li> SML/NJ 0.93 on Suns and SGIs. There seem to be several
problems with Linux and HP-UX, though.
<li> Poly/ML versions 2.x and 3.1 on Suns.
</ul>

<p>

<a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/software.html">SML/NJ</a>
needs lots of store and disk space, but it is free.  The current
official release is 110 (there is an <a
href="ftp://ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/MIRRORED/smlnj/release/110/smlnj-110.0-3.i386.rpm">RPM
archive</a> available for Linux/x86).  We still support the old 0.93
release, but do not recommend to use it.

<p>

<a href="http://www.harlequin.com/products/ads/ml/">MLWorks</a> is a
commercial ML programming environment.  Isabelle on MLWorks 2.0 works
well.  It is about 20% faster than on SML/NJ while using slightly less
memory and disk space.  A few minor features (e.g. ML top-level pretty
printing) are not yet supported, though.

<p>

Poly/ML used to be a commercial product by Abstract Hardware Limited
(now Abstract, Inc.).  It is no longer available.  We're awaiting news
about future availability of Poly/ML.

<p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

Binary rpm packages are available for Isabelle/HOL and ZF on the
Linux/x86 platform.  Alternatively, the system may be built from
scratch as described in file <tt>INSTALL</tt> of the Isabelle sources.
Further background information may be found in the <em>Isabelle System
Manual</em>, distributed with the sources (directory <tt>doc</tt>).


<h2>Interfaces</h2>

The distribution includes only a very primitive interface based on
ordinary terminal sessions.

<p>

<a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/da/Isamode/">Isamode</a> by
David Aspinall is a more elaborate interface for Isabelle.  It runs
under recent versions of XEmacs and is useful to both novices and
experts.

<p>

<a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/proofgen/">Proof General</a> is
a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants, including Isabelle (as
of version 2.0).  Proof General is suitable for use by pacifists and
Emacs militants alike. Its most prominent feature is script
management, providing a metaphor of <em>live proof script
editing</em>.

Please report any problems you encounter.  While we shall try to be
helpful, we can accept no responsibility for the deficiencies of
Isabelle and their consequences.
