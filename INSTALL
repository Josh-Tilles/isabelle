***************************************************************************

IMPORTANT NOTE: This file describes the *new* installation procedure
using various scripts that are still supposed beta for Isabelle94-8.
If you encounter any problems, you may want to try compiling Isabelle
the olden way as described in README.

Isabelle installation notes
===========================

1. Unpacking
------------

Unpacking the Isabelle distribution archive (using tar and gzip)
leaves you with some directory IsabelleYY-X. You may install this
anywhere, but please just *not* as ~/isabelle!!!

The place where you put the contents of IsabelleYY-X will be referred
to as [ISABELLE_HOME] subsequently.


2. Auto configuration
---------------------

There are some minor adaptions to be made of the Isabelle distribution
to your system environment. Simply type:

  cd [ISABELLE_HOME]
  ./configure


3. ML system settings and compilation
-------------------------------------

Before actual compilation you have to tell Isabelle about your
Standard ML system.  These settings reside in ./etc/settings, which
may be also overridden by ~/isabelle/etc/settings. There are already
various sample configurations in ./etc/settings commented out.

To build the core Isabelle/Pure and the default object-logic, just
type:

  ./build

More object-logics can be made similarly:

  ./build FOL HOL


4. Running the system
---------------------

Provided that compilation was succesful, you can now run something
like:

  [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin/isabelle FOL

to start and interactive Isabelle session within your current
terminal.  You may want to put [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin into your shell's
PATH. Please do *not* copy (or link) the Isabelle scripts somewhere
else -- or they just won't work!
