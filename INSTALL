Isabelle installation and compilation notes
===========================================

1) User installation
--------------------

Here we assume that Isabelle has already been installed at your site.
Otherwise see 2) below of how to get the Isabelle system installed in
the first place.


1a) Running the Isabelle binaries
---------------------------------

The Isabelle binaries (isatool, isabelle, Isabelle) may be invoked
directly from their location within the distribution directory
[ISABELLE_HOME] like this:

  [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin/isabelle HOL

This starts an interactive Isabelle session within your current text
terminal.  You may want to put [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin into your shell's
search PATH, but this is not strictly necessary.


Please do *not* copy (or link) the Isabelle scripts anywhere else ---
they just won't work!  If you really want to install independent
Isabelle binaries somewhere else then do it like this:

  [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin/isatool install -p ~/bin

Your site-wide Isabelle installation may already provide Isabelle
executables in some global bin directory (such as /usr/bin).


1b) Isabelle as KDE application
-------------------------------

Isabelle may be installed as application icon on the KDE desktop like
this:

  [ISABELLE_HOME]/bin/isatool install -k

Clicking on that icon will invoke the interface wrapper script
(capital Isabelle), which may be configured to run your favorite
Isabelle user interface via the ISABELLE_INTERFACE setting.
Additional options may be passed by editing the application's command
line (by using the standard KDE desktop functionality).


2) System installation
----------------------

The Isabelle distribution is available both as traditional source-only
tar.gz archives, and as binary packages (currently only RPM for
Linux/x86).  In any case, the resulting Isabelle installation always
contains the full sources, thus any part of the system be recompiled
later, too.


2a) Binary installation
----------------------

Ready-to-go RPM packages are provided for the ML compiler and runtime
system, the Isabelle sources, and some major object-logics.  These
packages should work on any major RPM-based Linux/x86 platform (such
as SuSE, RedHat etc.).  A typical installation procedure would be like
this (executed as root):

  rpm -i smlnj-110.0-3.i386.rpm
  rpm -i --prefix /usr/share isabelle.rpm
  rpm -i --prefix /usr/share isabelle-HOL.i386.rpm

The install prefix may be changed as indicated.  By default the ML
system is expected to be at the same directory level as Isabelle
itself; changing this arrangement requires
[ISABELLE_HOME]/etc/settings to be adapted manually.


Note that isabelle.rpm and isabelle-pdfdocs.rpm already contain all of
Isabelle as platform independent sources.  Precompiled object-logics
are provided for convenience.


Recompiling logics
------------------

Some people prefer to be able to reconstruct the full system from the
sources, rather than installing RPM packages blindly.  We do not
provide source RPMs, yet any parts of Isabelle may be recompiled after
installation of the main isabelle.rpm package (which contains only
sources anyway).

Assuming proper configuration of the underlying ML system, Isabelle
object-logics may be recompiled like this:

  [ISABELLE_HOME]/build HOL FOL


Source installation
-------------------

Traditional tar.gz archives are provided for the full Isabelle sources
and documentation as well.  Make sure your ML system (SML/NJ, Poly/ML
etc.) has already been installed properly; then proceed as follows.


* Unpacking the archives.  After unpacking the Isabelle distribution
archives (using tar and gzip) you are left with some directory
IsabelleYY-X.  Basically, this may be installed anywhere --- just note
that ~/isabelle would be a really bad idea, though.  The place where
you put the contents of IsabelleYY-X will be referred to as
[ISABELLE_HOME] subsequently.


* Auto configuration.  There are some minor adaptions to be made of
the Isabelle distribution to your system environment (mostly locations
of bash and perl).  Simply do it like this:

  cd [ISABELLE_HOME]
  ./configure

Note that this does not store any references to [ISABELLE_HOME].  You
may safely move the system later, without having to run ./configure
again.


* ML system settings and compilation.  Before actual compilation you
have to tell Isabelle about your Standard ML system.  These settings
reside in ./etc/settings, which may be also overridden by
~/isabelle/etc/settings. There are already various sample
configurations in ./etc/settings commented out.

To build the core Isabelle/Pure and the default object-logic, just
type

  ./build

More object-logics can be made in a similar fashion:

  ./build FOL HOL

After successful compilation you are ready to run the system, see 1)
above for more information.
