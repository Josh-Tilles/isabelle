                        Pure: The Pure Isabelle System


This directory contains the ML source files for Pure Isabelle, which
is the basis for all object-logics:

  IsaMakefile	compiles the Pure system (use isatool make)
  ML-Systems/   compatibility files for various ML systems
  General/	general tools
  Syntax/     	the syntax module
  Thy/          the theory file parser and loader
  Isar/		Intelligible Semi-Automated Reasoning subsystem
  ./		the actual meta logic implementation (see ROOT.ML)

Isabelle programmers may want to have a look at the following generic
modules:

  Library	basic library (see library.ML)
  TableFun	efficient tables (see General/table.ML)
  Seq		unbounded sequences (see General/seq.ML)
  Pretty	pretty printing module (see Syntax/pretty.ML)
  Scan		scanner toolbox (see Syntax/scan.ML)
  Source	co-algebraic data sources (see Syntax/source.ML)
  Symbol	generalized characters (see Syntax/symbol.ML)
  Path		abstract algebra of file paths (see General/path.ML)
  File		file system operations (see General/file.ML)
  NameSpace	hierarchically structured name spaces (see General/name_space.ML)
