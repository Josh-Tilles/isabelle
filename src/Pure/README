This directory contains the ML source files for Pure Isabelle, which
is the basis for all object-logics:

  IsaMakefile	compiles the Pure system (use isatool make)
  ML-Systems/   compatibility files for various ML systems
  General/	general tools
  Syntax/     	the syntax module
  Thy/          the theory file parser (old format) and loader
  Isar/		Intelligible Semi-Automated Reasoning subsystem
  ./		the actual meta logic implementation (see ROOT.ML)

Isabelle programmers may want to have a look at the generic modules
Library (see library.ML) and those in General/ (see General/README).
