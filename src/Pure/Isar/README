This directory contains the Isabelle/Isar subsystem -- Intelligible
Semi-Automated Reasoning for Isabelle.  Interesting modules include:

  Proof		(core of the Isar/VM interpreter)
  Args		(concrete argument syntax of attributes and methods)
  Method	(proof methods)
  Attrib	(attributes)

  LocalDefs	(local definitions)
  Calculation	(calculational proofs)
  ObtainFun     (generalized existence reasoning)

  Toplevel	(the Isabelle/Isar toplevel)
  IsarThy	(Isar derived theory operations)
  IsarCmd	(non-logical commands)
  IsarSyn	(syntax for Pure/Isar commands)

  OuterParse	(outer syntax parser combinators, see also
                 Pure/General/scan.ML)
  OuterSyntax   (outer syntax main)
  IsarOutput    (token-level theory output)
