This directory contains the source files for Isabelle's syntax module,
which includes a lexer, parser, pretty printer and macro system. Note
that only the following structures are supposed to be exported:

  Pretty        (generic pretty printing module)
  Scan          (generic scanner toolbox)
  Symbol	(baroque characters)

  Syntax        (internal interface to the syntax module)
  BasicSyntax   (part of Syntax made pervasive)
