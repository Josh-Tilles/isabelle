                              Pure/Syntax/

This directory contains the source files for Isabelle's syntax module, which
includes a lexer, parser, pretty printer and macro system. Note that only
structures Pretty, Syntax and BasicSyntax are supposed to be exported.

There is no Makefile to compile these files separately; they are compiled as
part of Pure Isabelle.
