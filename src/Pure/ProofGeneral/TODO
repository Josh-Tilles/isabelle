Major:

 split out Emacs part of Pure/proof_general.ML and move here 
 as proof_general_emacs.ML.  Remove isa support.

 Complete pgip_types: add PGML and objtypes

 Complete pgip_markup: provide markup abstraction for parsing.ML


Minor:

 <pgipquit> broken

 cleanups: signatures & structures

 further tests in pgip_tests.ML
