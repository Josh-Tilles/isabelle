#Shell script to expand shorthand goal commands
#  ALSO contracts uses of resolve_tac, dresolve_tac, eresolve_tac,
#     rewrite_goals_tac on 1-element lists
#  ALSO expands tabs, since they are now forbidden in strings.
#
# Usage:
#    expandshort FILE1 ... FILEn
#
#Renames old versions of the files as FILE1~~ ... FILEn~~
#
