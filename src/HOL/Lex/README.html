<H1>A Simplified Scanner Generator</H1>

This is half of a simplified functional scanner generator. The overall design
is like this:
<PRE>
         regular expression
                  |
                  v
             -----------
             | mk_auto |
             -----------
                  |
        deterministic automaton
                  |
                  v
           ----------------
string --> | auto_chopper | --> chopped up string
           ----------------
</PRE>
A chopped up string is a pair of
<UL>
<LI>a prefix of the input string, chopped up into words of the language,
<LI>together with the remaining suffix.
</UL>
For example, if the language consists just of the word <KBD>ab</KBD>, the
input <KBD>ababaab</KBD> is partitioned into a chopped up prefix
<KBD>[ab,ab]</KBD> and the suffix <KBD>aab</KBD>.
<P>

The auto_chopper is implemented in theory AutoChopper. An alternative (more
efficient) version is defined in AutoChopper1. However, no properties have
been proved for it yet.

The top part of the diagram, i.e. the translation of regular expressions into
deterministic finite automata is still missing (although we have some bits
and pieces).
<P>

The directory also contains Regset_of_auto, a theory describing the
translation of deterministic automata into regular sets.
