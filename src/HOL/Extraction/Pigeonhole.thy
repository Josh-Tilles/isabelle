We formalize two proofs of the pigeonhole principle, which lead
to extracted programs of quite different complexity. The original
formalization of these proofs in {\sc Nuprl} is due to
Aleksey Nogin \cite{Nogin-ENTCS-2000}.

We need decidability of equality on natural numbers:

The programs extracted from the above proofs look as follows:
@{thm [display] pigeonhole_def}
@{thm [display] pigeonhole_slow_def}
The program for searching for an element in an array is
@{thm [display,eta_contract=false] search_def}
The correctness statement for @{term "pigeonhole"} is
@{thm [display] pigeonhole_correctness [no_vars]}

In order to analyze the speed of the above programs,
we generate ML code from them.
