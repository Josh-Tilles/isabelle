<H1>Type Inference for MiniML (without <tt>let</tt>)</H1>

This theory defines the type inference rules and the type inference algorithm
<em>W</em> for simply-typed lambda terms due to Milner. It proves the
soundness and completeness of <em>W</em> w.r.t. to the rules. An optimized
version <em>I</em> is shown to implement <em>W</em>.

<P>

A report describing the theory is found here:<br>

<P>

<B>NOTE:</B> This theory has been superseded by a more recent development
which formalizes type inference for a language including <tt>let</tt>. For
