text {* The following document presents a proof that the Continuum is
uncountable. It is formalised in the Isabelle/Isar theorem proving
system.

{\em Theorem:} The Continuum @{text "\<real>"} is not denumerable. In other
words, there does not exist a function @{text "f: \<nat> \<Rightarrow> \<real>"} such that f is
surjective.

{\em Outline:} An elegant informal proof of this result uses Cantor's
Diagonalisation argument. The proof presented here is not this
one. First we formalise some properties of closed intervals, then we
prove the Nested Interval Property. This property relies on the
completeness of the Real numbers and is the foundation for our
argument. Informally it states that an intersection of countable
closed intervals (where each successive interval is a subset of the
last) is non-empty. We then assume a surjective function @{text
"f: \<nat> \<Rightarrow> \<real>"} exists and find a real x such that x is not in the range of f
by generating a sequence of closed intervals then using the NIP. *}
