<H3>Architecture</H3>

Nitrox is the first-order version of Nitpick [<A HREF="#References">BN10</A>],
an open source counterexample generator for Isabelle/HOL
[<A HREF="#References">NPW13</A>]. It builds on Kodkod
[<A HREF="#References">TJ07</A>], a highly optimized first-order relational
model finder based on SAT. The name Nitrox is a portmanteau of <b><i>Nit</i></b>pick
and Pa<b><i>r</i></b>ad<b><i>ox</i></b> (clever, eh?).

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<p>
Nitrox employs Kodkod to find a finite model of the negated conjecture. It
performs a few transformations on the input, such as pushing quantifiers inside,
but 99% of the solving logic is in Kodkod and the underlying SAT solver.

<p>
The translation from HOL to Kodkod's first-order relational logic (FORL) is
parameterized by the cardinalities of the atomic types occurring in it. Nitrox
enumerates the possible cardinalities for the universe. If a formula has a
finite counterexample, the tool eventually finds it, unless it runs out of
resources.

<p>
Nitpick is optimized to work with higher-order logic (HOL) and its definitional
principles (e.g., (co)inductive predicates, (co)inductive datatypes,
(co)recursive functions). When invoked on untyped first-order problem, few of
its optimizations come into play, and the problem handed to Kodkod is
essentially a first-order relational logic (FORL) rendering of the TPTP FOF
problem. There are two main exceptions:
<ul>
<li> Nested quantifiers are moved as far inside the formula as possible before
Kodkod gets a chance to look at them [<A HREF="#References">BN10</A>].
<li> Definitions invoked with fixed arguments are specialized.
</ul>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>
Nitrox, like most of Isabelle/HOL, is written in Standard ML. Unlike Isabelle
itself, which adheres to the LCF small-kernel discipline, Nitrox does not
certify its results and must be trusted. Kodkod is written in Java. MiniSat 1.14
is used as the SAT solver.

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

Since Nitpick was designed for HOL, it doesn't have any type inference &agrave;
la Paradox. It also doesn't use the SAT solver incrementally, which penalizes it
a bit (but not as much as the missing type inference). Kodkod itself is known to
perform less well on FOF than Paradox, because it is designed and optimized for
a somewhat different logic, FORL. On the other hand, Kodkod's symmetry breaking
might be better calibrated than Paradox's. Hence, we expect Nitrox to end up in
second or third place in the FNT category.
