Isabelle/HOL 2013 at CASC-24

Notes to Geoff:

  Once you have open the archive, Isabelle and its tool are ready to go. The
  various tools are invoked as follows:

  	Isabelle, competition version:
  		./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle %d %s

  	Isabelle, demo version:
  		./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle_hot %d %s

  	Nitpick and Nitrox:
  		./bin/isabelle tptp_nitpick %d %s

  	Refute:
  		./bin/isabelle tptp_refute %d %s

  Here's an example:

    ./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle_hot 300 $TPTP/Problems/SET/SET014^4.p

  The output should look as follows:

    > val it = (): unit
    val commit = fn: unit -> bool
    Loading theory "Scratch_tptp_isabelle_hot_29414_2568"
    running nitpick for 7 s
    FAILURE: nitpick
    running simp for 15 s
    SUCCESS: simp
    % SZS status Theorem

  Additional sanity tests:

  	./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle_hot 300 $TPTP/Problems/CSR/CSR150^3.p
  	./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle_hot 300 $TPTP/Problems/SYO/SYO304^5.p
    ./bin/isabelle tptp_isabelle_hot 300 $TPTP/Problems/PUZ/PUZ087^1.p

  The first problem is unprovable; the second one is proved by Satallax; the
  third one is proved by LEO-II.

  All the tools accept CNF, FOF, TFF0, or THF0 problems and output SZS statuses
  of the form

  	% SZS status XXX

  where XXX is in the set

    {Unknown, TimedOut, Unsatisfiable, Theorem, Satisfiable, CounterSatisfiable}

  Nitpick and Nitrox also output a model within "% SZS begin" and "% SZS end"
  tags.

  In 2011, there were some problems with Java (needed for Nitpick), because it
  required so much memory at startup. I doubt there will be any problems this
  year, because Isabelle now includes its own version of Java, but the solution
  back then was to replace

  	exec "$ISABELLE_TOOL" java

  in the last line of the "contrib/kodkodi-1.5.2/bin/kodkodi" script with

  	/usr/lib64/jvm/java-1.5.0-gcj-4.5-1.5.0.0/jre/bin/java

  See the emails we exchanged on July 18, 2011, with the subject "No problem on
  my Linux 64-bit".

  Enjoy!


Notes to myself:

  I downloaded the official Isabelle2013 Linux package from

    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2013_linux.tar.gz

  on a "macbroy" machine and renamed the directory "Isabelle2013-CASC". I built
  a "HOL-TPTP" image:

    ./bin/isabelle build -b HOL-TPTP

  I copied the heaps over to "./heaps":

    mv ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2013/heaps .

  To use this image and suppress some scary output, I added

    HOL-TPTP | grep --line-buffered -v "^###\|^PROOF FAILED for depth\|^Failure node\|inferences so far.  Searching to depth\|^val it = (): unit"

  to the next-to-last lines of "src/HOL/TPTP/lib/Tools/tptp_[inrs]*".

  At this point I tested the "SYN044^4" mentioned above.

  I renamed "README" to "README.orig" and copied this "ReadMe" over.

  Next, I installed and enabled ATPs.

  LEO-II (1.4.3):

    I logged to a 32-bit Linux ("lxlabbroy") machine. I retrieved LEO-II from

      http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~leo/leo2_v1.4.3.tgz

    I did "make opt". I copied
    "bin/leo.opt" to "~/Isabelle2013-CASC/contrib/leo".

    I added this line to "etc/settings":

      LEO2_HOME=$ISABELLE_HOME/contrib

  Satallax (2.7):

    I logged to a 32-bit Linux ("lxlabbroy") machine. I retrieved Satallax from

      http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~cebrown/satallax/downloads/satallax-2.7.tar.gz

    I added E to the path so that it gets detected by Satallax's configure
    script:

      export PATH=$PATH:~/Isabelle2013-CASC/contrib/e-1.6-2/x86-linux

    I followed the instructions in "satallax-2.7/INSTALL". I copied
    "bin/satallax.opt" to "~/Isabelle2013-CASC/contrib/satallax".

    I added this line to "etc/settings":

      SATALLAX_HOME=$ISABELLE_HOME/contrib

  Vampire (2.6):

    I copied the file "vampire_rel.linux64" from the 2012 CASC archive to
    "~/Isabelle2013-CASC/contrib/vampire".

    I added these lines to "etc/settings":

      VAMPIRE_HOME=$ISABELLE_HOME/contrib
      VAMPIRE_VERSION=2.6

  Z3 (3.2):

    I uncommented the following line in "contrib/z3-3.2/etc/settings":

      # Z3_NON_COMMERCIAL="yes"

  To test that the examples actually worked, I did

    ./bin/isabelle tty
    theory T imports Main begin;
    lemma "a = b ==> [b] = [a]";
    sledgehammer [e leo2 satallax spass vampire z3 z3_tptp] ();

  and I performed the aforementioned sanity tests.

  Ideas for next year:

    * Unfold definitions, esp. if it makes the problem more first-order (cf.
      "SEU466^1").
    * Detect and remove needless definitions.
    * Expand "p b" to "(b & p True) | (~ b & p False)" (cf. "CSR148^3").
    * Select subset of axioms (cf. "CSR148^3").

  That's it.
