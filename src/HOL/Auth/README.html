<H1>Auth--The Inductive Approach to Verifying Security Protocols</H1>

<P>Cryptographic protocols are of major importance, especially with the
growing use of the Internet.  This directory demonstrates a new proof method,
which is described in <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/protocols.html">various
papers</A>.  The operational semantics of protocol participants is defined
inductively.  

<P>This directory contains proofs concerning

<UL>
<LI>three versions of the Otway-Rees protocol

<LI>the Needham-Schroeder protocol (public-key and shared-key versions)

<LI>two versions of Kerberos: the simplified form published in the BAN paper
	and also the full protocol (Kerberos IV)

<LI>three versions of the Yahalom protocol, including a bad one that 
	illustrates the purpose of the Oops rule

<LI>a novel recursive authentication protocol 

<LI>the Internet protocol TLS
