Type inference for MiniML (without "let" for the time being).

Algorithms W and I are based on

@article{Milner-Poly,author="Robin Milner",
title="A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming",
journal="J. Comp.\ Sys.\ Sci.",year=1978,volume=17,pages="348--375"}

which also proves their correctness.  The first completeness proof was given
in

@phdthesis{Damas-PhD,author={Luis Manuel Martins Damas},
title={Type Assignment in Programming Languages},
school={Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh},year=1985}

The Isabelle proofs are based on
