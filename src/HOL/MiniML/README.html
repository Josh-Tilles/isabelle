<H1>Type Inference for MiniML (without <kb>let<kb>)</H1>

This theory defines the type inference rules and the type inference algorithm
<em>W</em> for simply-typed lambda terms due to Milner. It proves the
soundness and completeness of <em>W</em> w.r.t. to the rules. An optimized
version <em>I</em> is shown equivalent to <em>W</em> (one direction only).

A report describing the theory is found here:<br>
