<H1>Type Inference for MiniML (without <kbd>let</kbd>)</H1>

This theory formalizes the basic type inference algorithm underlying all
typed functional programming languages. This algorithm is called
<kbd>W</kbd>, its more imperative variant is called <kbd>I</kbd>. Both were
first described in

Task: extend MiniML with a <kbd>let</kbd>-construct and polymorphic types. We
are looking for an enthusiastic student with some basic knowledge of
functional programming who is not afraid of logic and proofs.  Sounds
interesting? Then contact <A
