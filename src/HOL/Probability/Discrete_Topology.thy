instance discrete :: (type) complete_space
proof
  fix X::"nat\<Rightarrow>'a discrete" assume "Cauchy X"
  hence "\<exists>n. \<forall>m\<ge>n. X n = X m"
    by (force simp: dist_discrete_def Cauchy_def split: split_if_asm dest:spec[where x=1])
  then guess n ..
  thus "convergent X"

qed

instance discrete :: (countable) countable
proof

instance discrete :: (countable) second_countable_topology
proof
  let ?B = "range (\<lambda>n::'a discrete. {n})"
  have "\<And>S. generate_topology ?B (\<Union>x\<in>S. {x})"
    by (intro generate_topology_Union) (auto intro: generate_topology.intros)
  then have "open = generate_topology ?B"
    by (auto intro!: ext simp: open_discrete_def)
  moreover have "countable ?B" by simp
  ultimately show "\<exists>B::'a discrete set set. countable B \<and> open = generate_topology B" by blast
