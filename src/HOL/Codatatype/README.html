<h3><i>Codatatype</i>: A (co)datatype package based on bounded natural functors
(BNFs)</h3>

<p>
The <i>Codatatype</i> package provides a fully modular framework for
constructing inductive and coinductive datatypes in HOL, with support for mixed
mutual and nested (co)recursion. Mixed (co)recursion enables type definitions
involving both datatypes and codatatypes, such as the type of finitely branching
trees of possibly infinite depth. The framework draws heavily from category
theory.

<p>
The package is described in the following paper:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~traytel/papers/codatatypes/index.html">Foundational, Compositional (Co)datatypes for Higher-Order Logic&mdash;Category Theory Applied to Theorem Proving</a>, <br>
  Dmitriy Traytel, Andrei Popescu, and Jasmin Christian Blanchette.<br>
  <i>Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2012)</i>, 2012.
</ul>

<p>
The main entry point for applications is <tt>Codatatype.thy</tt>.
The <tt>Examples</tt> directory contains various examples of (co)datatypes,
including the examples from the paper.

<p>
The key notion underlying the package is that of a <i>bounded natural functor</i>
(<i>BNF</i>)&mdash;an enriched type constructor satisfying specific properties
preserved by interesting categorical operations (composition, least fixed point,
and greatest fixed point). The <tt>Basic_BNFs.thy</tt> file registers
various basic types, notably for sums, products, function spaces, finite sets,
multisets, and countable sets. Custom BNFs can be registered as well.

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> The package is under development. Future versions are expected
to support multiple constructors and selectors per (co)datatype (instead of a
single <i>fld</i> or <i>unf</i> constant) and provide a nicer syntax for
(co)induction and (co)recursive function definitions. Please contact
