subsubsection {* List comprehension *}

text{* Input syntax for Haskell-like list comprehension notation.
Typical example: @{text"[(x,y). x \<leftarrow> xs, y \<leftarrow> ys, x \<noteq> y]"},
the list of all pairs of distinct elements from @{text xs} and @{text ys}.
The syntax is as in Haskell, except that @{text"|"} becomes a dot
(like in Isabelle's set comprehension): @{text"[e. x \<leftarrow> xs, \<dots>]"} rather than
\verb![e| x <- xs, ...]!.

The qualifiers after the dot are
\begin{description}
\item[generators] @{text"p \<leftarrow> xs"},
 where @{text p} is a pattern and @{text xs} an expression of list type, or
\item[guards] @{text"b"}, where @{text b} is a boolean expression.
%\item[local bindings] @ {text"let x = e"}.
\end{description}

Just like in Haskell, list comprehension is just a shorthand. To avoid
misunderstandings, the translation into desugared form is not reversed
upon output. Note that the translation of @{text"[e. x \<leftarrow> xs]"} is
optmized to @{term"map (%x. e) xs"}.

It is easy to write short list comprehensions which stand for complex
expressions. During proofs, they may become unreadable (and
mangled). In such cases it can be advisable to introduce separate
definitions for the list comprehensions in question.  *}

(*
Proper theorem proving support would be nice. For example, if
@{text"set[f x y. x \<leftarrow> xs, y \<leftarrow> ys, P x y]"}
produced something like
@{term"{z. EX x: set xs. EX y:set ys. P x y \<and> z = f x y}"}.

text {*
  Only use @{text mem} for generating executable code.  Otherwise use
  @{prop "x : set xs"} instead --- it is much easier to reason about.
  The same is true for @{const list_all} and @{const list_ex}: write
  @{text "\<forall>x\<in>set xs"} and @{text "\<exists>x\<in>set xs"} instead because the HOL
  quantifiers are aleady known to the automatic provers. In fact, the
  declarations in the code subsection make sure that @{text "\<in>"},
  @{text "\<forall>x\<in>set xs"} and @{text "\<exists>x\<in>set xs"} are implemented
  efficiently.

  Efficient emptyness check is implemented by @{const null}.

  The functions @{const filtermap} and @{const map_filter} are just
  there to generate efficient code. Do not use
  them for modelling and proving.
