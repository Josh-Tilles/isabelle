<H1>Micro Java</H1>

This theory defines Micro Java, a small fragment of the programming language
Java (essentially just classes), together with a corresponding virtual
machine and a specification of its bytecode verifier. It is shown that Micro
Java and the given specification of the bytecode verifier are type safe.

The theory was developed by David von Oheimb, Cornelia Pusch and Tobias
Nipkow as part of the DFG-funded project

Java is in preparation. Until it has appeared, please consult the Bali home
