<H2>IMP --- A <KBD>while</KBD>-language and its 3 Semantics</H2>

The formalization of the denotational, operational and axiomatic semantics of
a simple while-language, including
<UL>
<LI> an equivalence proof between denotational and operational semantics and
<LI> a soundness proof of the Hoare rules w.r.t. the denotational semantics.
</UL>
The whole development essentially formalizes/transcribes chapters 2, 5 and 6 of
<P>
<KBD>
@book{Winskel, author = {Glynn Winskel},
title = {The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages},
publisher = {MIT Press}, year = 1993}
</KBD>
<P>
In addition, a verification-condition-generator is proved sound and complete
w.r.t. the Hoare rules.
