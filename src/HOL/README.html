<H2>HOL: Higher-Order Logic with curried functions</H2>

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
Higher-Order Logic with curried functions.  Important files include

<DL>
<DT>ROOT.ML
<DD>loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type: use "ROOT.ML";<P>

<DT>Makefile
<DD>compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey<P>

<DT>ex
<DD>subdirectory containing examples.  To execute them, enter an ML image
containing HOL and type: use "ex/ROOT.ML";<P>

<DT>Subst
<DD>subdirectory defining a theory of substitution and unification.
