<H2>HOL: Higher-Order Logic</H2>

This directory contains the ML sources of the Isabelle system for
Higher-Order Logic.<P>

There are several subdirectories with examples:
<DL>
<DT>ex
<DD>general examples

<DT>Auth
<DD>a new approach to verifying authentication protocols 

<DT>IMP
<DD>mechanization of a large part of a semantics text by Glynn Winskel

<DT>Induct
<DD>examples of (co)inductive definitions

<DT>Integ 
<DD>a development of the integers including efficient integer
calculations (part of the standard HOL environment)

<DT>IOA
<DD>extended example of Input/Output Automata

<DT>Lambda
<DD>a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem for lambda-calculus

<DT>Real 
<DD>a development of the reals and hyper-reals, which are used in
non-standard analysis.  Also includes the positive rationals.  Used to build
the image HOL-Real.

<DT>Subst
<DD>defines a theory of substitution and unification.

<DT>Tools
<DD>holds code used to provide support for records, datatypes, induction, etc.

<DT>UNITY
<DD>Chandy and Misra's UNITY formalism.
