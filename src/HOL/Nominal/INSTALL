can be set up. The building process needs to be started
inside the [ISABELLE_HOME] directory with the command:

   ./build -m HOL-Nominal

After the build completes, install the files with the command

   ./bin/isatool install -p /usr/local/bin

The sources sources of the nominal datatype package
can be found in the directory

    [ISABELLE_HOME]/src/HOL/Nominal

=============================================================
