<h2>Invoking Model Checkers in Isabelle/HOL</h2>

This directory contains the basic setup for integration of some model
checkers in Isabelle/HOL, together with a few basic examples.

<p>

Currently, best results are achieved with the <a
href="http://iseran.ira.uka.de/~armin/mucke/"><em>Mucke</em></a> model
checker (version 0.3.5 is known to work).  Theory <tt>MuCalculus</tt>
provides the syntactic and oracle interfaces, while
<tt>MuckeExample1</tt> and <tt>MuckeExample2</tt> demonstrate the
model checker tactic <tt>mc_mucke_tac</tt> in action.  To run the
examples yourself, you only have to point <tt>MUCKE_HOME</tt> in
Isabelle's <tt>etc/settings</tt> to the place where the Mucke binary
has been installed.

<p>

In order to support more realistic applications, the <a
href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/library/HOLCF/IOA/Modelcheck">HOLCF/IOA/Modelcheck</a>
session augments this basic mechanism by further infrastructure for
proofs about I/O automata.  There is a separate <a
href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/IOA/papers/IOA-modelcheck.pdf">paper</a>
available, describing model checking in Isabelle/IOA in more detail.
