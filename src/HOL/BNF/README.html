<h3><i>BNF</i>: A (co)datatype package based on bounded natural functors
(BNFs)</h3>

<p>
The <i>BNF</i> package provides a fully modular framework for constructing
inductive and coinductive datatypes in HOL, with support for mixed mutual and
nested (co)recursion. Mixed (co)recursion enables type definitions involving
both datatypes and codatatypes, such as the type of finitely branching trees of
possibly infinite depth. The framework draws heavily from category theory.

<p>
The package is described in <tt>isabelle doc datatypes</tt> and in the following
paper:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/~traytel/papers/lics12-codatatypes/index.html">Foundational, Compositional (Co)datatypes for Higher-Order Logic&mdash;Category Theory Applied to Theorem Proving</a>, <br>
  Dmitriy Traytel, Andrei Popescu, and Jasmin Christian Blanchette.<br>
  <i>Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2012)</i>, 2012.
</ul>

<p>
Most of the package is loaded as part of <tt>Main.thy</tt>. Additional
functionality is provided by <tt>BNF.thy</tt>. The <tt>Examples</tt> directory
contains various examples of (co)datatypes, including the examples from the
paper.

<p>
The key notion underlying the package is that of a <i>bounded natural functor</i>
(<i>BNF</i>)&mdash;an enriched type constructor satisfying specific properties
preserved by interesting categorical operations (composition, least fixed point,
and greatest fixed point). The <tt>Basic_BNFs.thy</tt>, <tt>More_BNFs.thy</tt>,
and <tt>Countable_Set_Type.thy</tt> files register various basic types, notably
for sums, products, function spaces, finite sets, multisets, and countable sets.
Custom BNFs can be registered as well.
