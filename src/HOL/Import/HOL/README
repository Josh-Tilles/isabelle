All the files in this directory (except this README, HOL4.thy, and
ROOT.ML) are automatically generated.  Edit the files in
../Generate-HOL and run "isatool make HOL-Complex-Generate-HOL" in
~~/src/HOL, if something needs to be changed.

To build the logic in this directory, simply do a "isatool make
HOL-Import-HOL" in ~~/src/HOL.

Note that the quick_and_dirty flag is on as default for this
directory, which means that the original HOL4 proofs are not consulted
at all.  If a real replay of the HOL4 proofs is desired, get and
unpack the HOL4 proof objects to somewhere on your harddisk, and set
the variable PROOF_DIRS to the directory where the directory "hol4"
is.  Now edit the ROOT.ML file to unset the quick_and_dirty flag and
do "isatool make HOL-Import-HOL" in ~~/src/HOL.
