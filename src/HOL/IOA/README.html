Author:     Konrad Slind, Tobias Nipkow and Olaf M&uuml;ller<BR>

This directory contains a formalization of the meta theory of I/O automata in HOL.
This formalization has been significantly changed and extended. The new version is available in the subdirectory HOLCF/IOA. There are also the proofs of two communication protocols which formerly
have been here.
