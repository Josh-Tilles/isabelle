<H2>GroupTheory -- Group Theory using Locales, including Sylow's Theorem</H2>

<P>This directory presents proofs about group theory, by
Florian Kammüller.  (Later, Larry Paulson simplified some of the proofs.)
These theories use locales and were indeed the original motivation for
locales.  However, this treatment of groups must still be regarded as
experimental.  We can expect to see refinements in the future.

Here is an outline of the directory's contents:

<UL> 
<LI>Theory <A HREF="Bij.html"><CODE>Bij</CODE></A>
defines bijections over sets and operations on them and shows that they
are a group.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="DirProd.html"><CODE>DirProd</CODE></A>
defines the product of two groups and proves that it is a group again.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="FactGroup.html"><CODE>FactGroup</CODE></A>
defines the factorization of a group and shows that the factorization a
normal subgroup is a group.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Homomorphism.html"><CODE>Homomorphism</CODE></A>
defines homomorphims and automorphisms for groups and rings and shows that
ring automorphisms are a group by using the previous result for
bijections.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Ring.html"><CODE>Ring</CODE></A>
and <A HREF="RingConstr.html"><CODE>RingConstr</CODE></A>
defines rings, proves a few basic theorems and constructs a lambda
function to extract the group that is part of the ring showing that it is
an abelian group. 

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Sylow.html"><CODE>Sylow</CODE></A>
contains a proof of the first Sylow theorem.
