This directory contains a sugared shallow semantic embedding of Hoare logic
for a while language. The implementation closely follows<P>

<DT>Syntax:
<DD> the letters a-z are interpreted as program variables,

The pre/post conditions can be arbitrary HOL formulae including program
variables. The program text should only refer to program variables.
