<H2>Semantic Embedding of Hoare Logic</H2>

This directory contains a sugared shallow semantic embedding of Hoare logic
for a while language. The implementation closely follows<P>

At the top level, it provides a tactic <B>hoare_tac</B>, which transforms a
goal

<KBD>{P} prog {Q}</KBD>

into a set of HOL-level verification conditions.
<DL>
<DT>Syntax:
<DD> the letters a-z are interpreted as program variables,
     all other identifiers as mathematical variables.<P>
</DL>
The pre/post conditions can be arbitrary HOL formulae including program
variables. The program text should only refer to program variables.
<P>
<B>Note</B>: Program variables are typed in the same way as HOL
variables. Although you can write programs over arbitrary types, all
program variables in a particular program must be of the same type!
