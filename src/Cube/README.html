<H2>Cube: Barendregt's Lambda-Cube</H2>

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
the Lambda-Cube.  Important files include

<DL>
<DT>ROOT.ML
<DD>loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type: use "ROOT.ML";<P>

<DT>Makefile
<DD>compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey<P>

<DT>ex
examples file. To execute them, enter an ML image
containing Cube and type: use "ex.ML";
</DL>

NB: the formalization is not completely sound!  It does not enforce
distinctness of variable names in contexts!<P>
