		Cube: Barendregt's Lambda-Cube

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
the Lambda-Cube.  Important files include

ROOT.ML -- loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type: use "ROOT.ML";

Makefile -- compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey

ex.ML -- examples file.  To execute them, enter an ML image
containing Cube and type:    use "ex.ML";

NB: the formalization is not completely sound!  It does not enforce
distinctness of variable names in contexts!
