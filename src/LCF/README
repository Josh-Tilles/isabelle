		LCF: Logic for Computable Functions

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
LCF.  It is loaded upon FOL, not Pure Isabelle.  Important files include

ROOT.ML -- loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing FOL and
type: use "ROOT.ML";

Makefile -- compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey

ex.ML -- files containing examples.  To execute them, enter an ML image
containing LCF and type:    use "ex.ML";
