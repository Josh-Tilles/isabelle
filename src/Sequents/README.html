<H2>Sequents: Various Sequent Calculi</H2>

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
various Sequent, Linear, and Modal Logic.  Important files include

<DL>
<DT>ROOT.ML
<DD>loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type:    use "ROOT.ML";

<DT>Makefile
<DD>compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey


<DT>ex
<DD>subdirectory containing examples.  Files are arranged in
subdirectories. To execute all of them, enter an ML image containing
Sequents and type 
<PRE>
	use "ex/ROOT.ML";
</PRE>
To execute examples in a particular logic (LK/ILL/Modal) use the
appropriate command:
<PRE>
	use "ex/LK/ROOT.ML";
	use "ex/ILL/ROOT.ML";
	use "ex/Modal/ROOT.ML";
</PRE>
</DL>

<P>Much of the work in Modal logic was done by Martin Coen. Thanks to
Rajeev Gore' for supplying the inference system for S43. Sara Kalvala
reorganized the files and supplied Linear Logic. Jacob Frost provided
some improvements to the syntax of sequents.
