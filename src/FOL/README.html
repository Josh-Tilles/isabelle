<h2>FOL: First-Order Logic with Natural Deduction</h2>

This directory contains the ML sources of the Isabelle system for
First-Order Logic (constructive and classical versions).  For a
classical sequent calculus, see LK.<p>

The <tt>ex</tt> subdirectory contains some examples.<p>

deduction in general.)
