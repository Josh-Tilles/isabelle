<H2>FOL: First-Order Logic with Natural Deduction</H2>

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
First-Order Logic (constructive and classical versions).  For a classical
sequent calculus, see LK.  Important files include

<DL>
<DT>ROOT.ML
<DD>loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type: use "ROOT.ML";<P>

<DT>Makefile
<DD>compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey<P>

<DT>ex
<DD>subdirectory containing examples.  To execute them, enter an ML image
containing FOL and type: use "ex/ROOT.ML";<P>
</DL>
