		FOL: First-Order Logic with Natural Deduction

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
First-Order Logic (constructive and classical versions).  For a classical
sequent calculus, see LK.  Important files include

ROOT.ML -- loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing Pure
Isabelle and type:    use "ROOT.ML";

Makefile -- compiles the files under Poly/ML or SML of New Jersey

ex -- subdirectory containing examples.  To execute them, enter an ML image
containing FOL and type:    use "ex/ROOT.ML";
