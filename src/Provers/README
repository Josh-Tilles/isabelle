			Provers

This directory contains ML sources of generic theorem proving tools.
Typically, they can be applied to various logics, provided rules of a
certain form are derivable.  Unfortunately, little documentation is
available.

classical.ML -- theorem prover for classical logics
genelim.ML   -- bits and pieces for deriving elimination rules
ind.ML       -- a simple induction package
simp.ML      -- a powerful simplifier
typedsimp.ML -- a rather basic simplifier for explicitly typed logics
