                 Provers: generic theorem proving tools

This directory contains ML sources of generic theorem proving tools.
Typically, they can be applied to various logics, provided rules of a
certain form are derivable.  Some of these are documented in the
Reference Manual.

  blast.ML              generic tableau prover with proof reconstruction
  clasimp.ML		combination of classical reasoner and simplifier
  classical.ML          theorem prover for classical logics
  hypsubst.ML           tactic to substitute in the hypotheses
  ind.ML                a simple induction package
  induct_method.ML      proof by cases and induction on sets and types (Isar)
  quantifier1.ML	simplification procedures for "1 point rules"
  simp.ML               powerful but slow simplifier
  simplifier.ML         fast simplifier
  split_paired_all.ML	turn surjective pairing into split rule
  splitter.ML           performs case splits for simplifier.ML
  trans.ML              transitivity reasoner for linear (total) orders
  typedsimp.ML          basic simplifier for explicitly typed logics
