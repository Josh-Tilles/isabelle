		Modal: First-Order Modal Sequent Calculus

This directory contains the Standard ML sources of the Isabelle system for
Modal Logic.  Important files include

ROOT.ML -- loads all source files.  Enter an ML image containing LK 
           and type: use "ROOT.ML";

ex -- subdirectory containing examples.  Files, Tthms.ML, S4thms.ML and
S43thms.ML contain the theorems of Modal Logics, so arranged since
T<S4<S43.  To execute them, enter an ML image containing Modal and type
	use "ex/ROOT.ML";

Thanks to Rajeev Gore' for supplying the inference system for S43.
